# Task Description

Modify the application from the first task of the Basic of .NET framework and C # by separating the functionality of counting the maximum number of unequal consecutive characters in a string into a separate method. Extend functionality by adding two more methods:
determining the maximum number of consecutive identical letters of the Latin alphabet in a line, determining the maximum number of consecutive identical digits in a line.

For each method, write Unit Tests (use the NUnit, XUnit or MSTest framework is your choice; follow AAA and FIRST). When creating tests, pay special attention to equivalence classes.

            <th>Rate</th>

    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Method for determining the maximum number of consecutive identical letters of the Latin alphabet in a line is created</td>
            <td>20%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Method for determining the maximum number of consecutive identical digits is created</td>
            <td>20%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Method for determining the maximum number of consecutive identical letters of the Latin alphabet in a line is covered by unit tests</td>
            <td>15%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Method for determining the maximum number of consecutive identical digits is covered by unit tests</td>
            <td>15%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>AAA and FIRST unit testing patterns are applied</td>
            <td>30%</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

**P.S.** I haven't understood what task is meant by saying *first task of the Basic of .NET framework and C#*, so I've just created two methods. I used NUnit framework.
